## Introduction

Employee churn, or employee turnover, refers to the rate at which employees leave a company. Predicting employee churn can help organizations take proactive measures to improve employee retention. This project uses machine learning algorithms to predict churn based on features such as job satisfaction, years at company, and more.

## Data

The dataset used in this project is `employee_data.csv`, which includes various features such as:

- Satisfaction Level
- Last Evaluation
- Number of Projects
- Average Monthly Hours
- Time Spent at Company
- Work Accident
- Promotion in Last 5 Years
- Department
- Salary
- Churn (target variable)

## Installation

To get a copy of this repository up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Parte02/Employee_Churn_Prediction.git
   cd Employee_Churn_Prediction
   ```

2. Install the required libraries:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Open Jupyter Notebook and navigate to the `notebooks` directory:
   ```sh
   jupyter notebook
   ```

2. Open the `Employee_Churn_Prediction.ipynb` notebook to view and run the code.

Alternatively, you can run the scripts directly from the command line:

1. Preprocess the data:
   ```sh
   python src/data_preprocessing.py
   ```

2. Train the model:
   ```sh
   python src/model_training.py
   ```

3. Evaluate the model:
   ```sh
   python src/model_evaluation.py
   ```

## Results

The results of the model evaluation, including performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, can be found in the `results/model_results.txt` file.
